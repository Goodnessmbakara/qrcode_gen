        <h1>About QRocket</h1>
        <p>QRocket is a simple and efficient QR code generator built for businesses, developers, and everyday users. Whether you're sharing a link, contact info, or any other kind of data, QRocket makes it quick and easy.</p>
        
        <h2>The Idea Behind QRocket</h2>
        <p>I’ve always loved fiddling with computers growing up, spending most of my time exploring how they work. One day, I stumbled upon coding tutorials on YouTube, and that was when my interest in development sparked. I wanted to build something practical that anyone can use—hence, QRocket was born!</p>
        <p>After doing some research, I joined the ALX programme to sharpen my skills, and this is the first project I’m proud to have worked on. I applied the knowledge I’ve gained so far, using languages and frameworks like Python and Django to bring QRocket to life.</p>

        <h2>Developer’s Journey</h2>
        <p>This project, QRocket, is my first major undertaking as a developer. Although I haven’t worked on any previous projects, I’ve put my heart and soul into this one. I contributed mainly by implementing the core backend functionality using the Django framework, allowing users to generate QR codes seamlessly.</p>
